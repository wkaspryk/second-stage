  <p>Second Stage Management Services Ltd. recognizes with gratitude how fortunate we are as individuals

and as a company. As a result of our good fortune, we have undertaken the support of several charities, 

the largest being Dress for Success® Vancouver. We donate time, creative endeavors and AV equipment 

to all their fundraising events. It is a small way we can repay our “Corporate Karma”.</p>
